# Android_Attendance_Manager
The objective of the project is to develop an android app that can manage all school 
activities like notice board, attendance, student feedback, new admission, the student login, and 
saving student’s database online.
I have used the android studio, firebase database during the project.
Admin/principal, teachers/faculties, students have their logins.
Admin can add/remove students, teachers, publish notice.
The teacher can take attendance, view students, publish notices.
Students can view attendance, reports.
